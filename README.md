# Recession_Prediction
---
This program aims to develop a warning signal for the occurrence of a recession 12 months in the future by training a model on past  macroeconomic data. The independent variables being used to train the model are the yield curve, expressed as the difference between the 10-yr and 3-month yields on US Treasury securities, and the Civilian Unemployment Rate. The original, raw data is monthly, but I then smooth these series using 3-month moving averages. All data used to build  the predictor is taken from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's Economic Database (FRED), while due credit for historical S&P500 returns is given to Yale Professor Robert Shiller: http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls.
