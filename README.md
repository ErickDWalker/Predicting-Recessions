# Predicting Recessions to Improve Asset Allocation Strategies


Overview
---
Conventional wisdom among investors often suggests that timing the stock market is a fool's errand. And while it is true that rapid trading in and out of the market generally yields subpar results, I would like to propose that a more disciplined, rule-based timing system can add value over time relative to a portfolio maintaining a fixed asset allocation. 

This proposal stems from two assumptions:  
1. Stock market returns are in part linked to macroeconomic cycles 
2. These macroeconomic cycles show some level of predictability. 

Specifically, and in reference to assumption #1, it is not a particularly novel idea to suggest that stock market returns are negatively impacted by economic recessions (see plot below). And so, if it can be shown that these economic downturns are to some degree predictable, it should follow that a countercyclical portfolio management strategy can be developed to exploit that fact.

To state the objective formally, this project focuses on building a classification model that can predict the occurrence of economic recessions in the U.S. 12-months prior to their onset. Scores output by this model are then used to develop trading rules that aim to shift a theoretical investor's portfolio out of equities before recessions - and the often substantial stock market declines that accompany them - begin. The "stock market" referred to throughout this text is the S&P 500, and any money not invested in the market at any given time is assumed to be invested in 10-year U.S. Treasuries.  


Data
---
**Time Frame:** January 1982 - May 2020.

The independent variables being used to train the model are the yield curve, expressed as the difference between yields on 10-yr and 3-month US Treasury securities, the Civilian Unemployment Rate (U3), and the NFCI Nonfinancial Leverage subindex. These variables are aggregated by month, and then smoothed using a 3-month SMA. The dependent variable is a binary indicator, with one (1) representing the occurrence of economic recession as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, and zero (0) the absence of one. To account for the fact that stock market declines do not perfectly coincide with the onset of recessions, this indicator is shifted 12-months into the past, with the aim of providing investors sufficient warning in advance to lower their equity exposure. All data used to build the recession prediction model is obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Database (FRED), while S&P500 return data is drawn from Professor Robert Shiller's publicly available data set.

Methodology

**Train | Test Split**  
I split the 1982-2020 period into training and test sets, with the dividing line between them being December, 2002. This provided a reasonable balance of recessionary and expansionary months in both sets.

**Model Selection**  
In selecting a model, I sought to choose a classifier and associated hyperparameters that produced the maximum F_Beta score. My aim in using this metric was to allow for a consideration of both recall and precision, thereby balancing the goal of shifting out of the market before a recession hits with the desire to remain invested during the majority of the marketâ€™s uptrends. Beta in this case was the ratio of the S&P 500's mean monthly returns during recessions to the same index's mean monthly returns during expansions. Out of the algorithms I tested, a Logistic Regression model adjusted for class imbalance performed best in this regard. Below is a plot of the three features used to build the model, and the scores produced (maroon line) when applying the model's *predict* method to the entire data set (after fitting the model on the training data set).

**Developing a Trading Strategy**  
After choosing a model I used the model's output scores to create rules that would shift an investor's portfolio out of the stock market sufficiently ahead of economic downturns. To do that I ran a number of simulations (in code, for loops) on a hypothetical portfolio, where each simulation adjusts the values of three variables to find the combination of values that yields the maximum portfolio return over the training time frame. These variables are:
1. The model score at which to lower the portfolio's equity allocation
2. The asset weights to shift the portfolio into once that model score is hit, and
3. The model score at which to resume the portfolio's baseline asset allocation 

Other than when the rules counsel a shift in asset allocation, portfolio weights are kept constant at a baseline allocation that can be chosen in advance by the user. The default baseline case used in the notebook for developing the rules was a classic 60 | 40 (stocks | bonds) portfolio. In deciding what asset weights to shift into (variable #2), the simulations were "instructed" to keep the portfolio's stock weight at or under the baseline's. In other words, with the default baseline 60 | 40 portfolio the stock weight was not allowed to be set higher than 60%. For simplicity, rebalancing to the baseline allocation is assumed to take place monthly, aligned with the frequency of the underlying return data.


Results
---
Stated formally, the trading rules resulting in the highest portfolio returns over the training set time frame were: Shift out of the stock market into a 10 | 90 (stocks | bonds) allocation once the model score hits 0.70, and hold that allocation until the model score reaches 0.10 or lower. At that point the portfolio returns to its baseline 60 | 40 allocation. Below is a plot displaying the execution of these rules over the training set period (1982-2002).

Over the test set time frame (January, 2003 - May, 2020) a 60 | 40 portfolio that followed the above trading rules would have adjusted its asset allocations as shown in the plot below.

It bears mentioning that while the rule successfully reduced the portfolio's equity allocation during the 2008-2009 recession,  it failed to do so during the recession started March 2020 (the model's score didn't reach the rule's 0.70 "trigger" level). Though this is far from ideal, I think two things are worth noting. First, the fact that the model's score failed to reach the 0.70 level triggering an allocation shift is not all that surprising considering the nature of the current recession. The cause of the decline in GDP in the U.S., and the speed at which it occurred, are unprecedented in the time frame over which the model was trained (and all of U.S. history). This would understandably make it more difficult for the model to make accurate predictions. Second, even with this "miss", the activation of the trading rules during the 2008-2009 recession was enough to lead to appreciable outperformance relative to the passive portfolio over the January, 2003 - May, 2020 window. In other words, the model and the rules derived from it need not be 100% accurate to add value; sidestepping the majority of recessions is enough.  

A 60 | 40 portfolio adjusting asset weights according to the trading rules earned a 9.44% CAGR, versus the passsive 60 | 40 portfolio's 7.77%. Translating that outperformance into dollars, an initial investment of $10,000 in the passive strategy would have grown to $36,634, while the trading portfolio would have grown to $47,779 (plot of the growth of $10,000 in various portfolios shown below). In addition the trading portfolio achieved this outperformance with a lower standard deviation of returns (1.87% vs 2.08%).

Conclusion
---
While this is not at all conclusive evidence that active management can reliably outperform its passive counterpart (many factors were not considered, e.g. taxes) I think it does open up a conversation around the debate. To reiterate the point made at the beginning, if it can be shown that economic downturns are to a large degree predictable, then it should be possible to construct trading strategies that take advantage of that predictability, and avoid substantial portions of the stock market's downturns. Putting aside this project's model for a moment, the idea that recessions are to some extent predictable is not new. As early as 1986, economist Campbell Harvey wrote his dissertation on using the yield curve to predict the business cycle. Given this, there are likely many more complex systems being developed than the one I devised here. 

Finally, for those concerned projects of this nature might exacerbate short-sightedness among investors, I think it is worth pointing out that a portfolio applying these allocation rules would likely not engage in the kind of frequent trading many disapprove of. Rather, an investor's portfolio would materially shift only twice every economic cycle. To me, this hardly qualifies as the kind of manic trading passive investors so often disparage. Instead, I would argue it can provide investors with a helpful signal that it may be prudent to temporarily "de-risk" their portfolio. For many, particularly those most vulnerable to losing their jobs during recessions, this can prove to be a valuable countercyclical adjustment, providing a cash buffer with which to safely navigate the economic downturn.
