# Recession_Prediction
This program will attempt to calculate a probability of recession 12 months in the future by training a model on past  macroeconomic data. 
The practical value of such a predictor is not limited to Federal Reserve officials who attempt to align interest rates with the current
phase of the economic cycle. Another envisioned use is for portfolio managers, who might wish to shift weights of various asset classes to
anticipate a decline in economic activity.   The independent variables being used to train the model are the yield curve, expressed as the
difference between the 10-yr and 3-month yields on US Treasury securities, and the Civilian Unemployment Rate. All data used to build  the
predictor is obtained from the Economic Database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED).
